The City Charter,\n    Administrative Code, Civil Service Commission rules, and Department of Human Resources\n    (DHR) policies all aim to ensure employees are selected and promoted based on merit, and\n    without discrimination. The foundation of these policies is the fundamental principal that\n    government jobs must be awarded based on fair and open recruitment and competition, and that\n    employment practices, including employee discipline must be free of bias.\n\n    The City’s workforce continues to be more diverse than the available local labor market. This is\n    the result of the City’s investment in programs such as anti-bias training, training and\n    enforcement of its Equal Employment Opportunity program, and implementation of a nationally-\n    recognized conviction history program that ensures all job applicants, regardless of conviction\n    history, have a fair chance at City employment.\n\n    While the City has a workforce which is more diverse than the local labor market, there is room\n    for improvement. In particular, the City still struggles for diversity in some jobs. In addition,\n    Proposition 209 (passed in 1996) amended the state constitution to prohibit California’s\n    governmental agencies, including the City, from considering race, sex, or ethnicity, specifically\n    in the areas of public employment, public contracting, and public education. Therefore, a diverse\n    applicant pool is a key component of ensuring the City’s workforce represents all of the\n    communities it serves.\n\n    The City has historically engaged in some targeted recruitment for specific roles. While some\n    City departments have focused recruitment programs and resources for recruitment, particularly\n    enterprise departments, there is no consistent or coordinated effort on behalf of all City\n    departments to ensure we are recruiting and attracting a diverse pool of applicants for all City\n    positions. The City’s recruitment efforts have largely consisted of posting an exam or job flyer\n    on the City website. This “post and pray” method of recruitment will not attract the quality,\n    diverse candidates the City needs to succeed in the 21st century.\n\n    Furthermore, the City must couple successful recruitment with the ability to retain the diverse\n    workforce it attracts. Equally as important as the diversity of the City’s workforce, is ensuring\n    that the workplace and employment related decisions such as hiring, promotions, and\n    terminations are free from bias, harassment, and discrimination. Throughout their working lives\n    with the City, employees must be evaluated based on their job performance, and not on who they\n    are. There is more work to do to ensure all City employees are treated with the fairness and\n    respect they deserve.\n\n\n                                 1 DR. CARLTON B. GOODLETT PLACE, ROOM 200\n                                    SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA 94102-4681\n                                         TELEPHONE: (415) 554-6141\n\f\nData and centralized reporting and tracking is a critical component of ensuring the City’s\nworkplace is free from harassment, bias and discrimination. Similarly it is important to help\nquantify the effectiveness of the City’s recruitment efforts and training of employees. Currently,\nCity departments do not consistently or universally report data on employee discipline, or\nprobationary releases to DHR making it slower and more intensive to evaluate any potential\ntrends or trouble spots in a department or division. Our departments and DHR, need to be\nproactive about investigating and addressing potential areas of bias and discrimination in the\nworkplace. Having consistent, and frequent data on hiring, employee discipline, releases and\nterminations from all City departments is critical to ensuring DHR can be proactive in\nidentifying and addressing these areas and ensuring there is transparency and accountability in\nemployment related decisions in the workplace.\n\nSan Francisco’s residents and visitors deserve the most qualified workforce possible, reflecting\nthe rich diversity of our communities. Additionally, workers deserve equal opportunity to be\nhired and to advance in their careers. Therefore, I am directing DHR, in its capacity as the central\nhuman resources agency for the City, work with City departments to pursue the following steps\nto promote equity, diversity, inclusion, and fairness in our workplaces.\n\n\nDirectives:\nThrough this Executive Directive, I hereby direct that action be taken as specified in the\nfollowing four areas:\n   1. Recruitment: DHR will hire two full-time staff to focus on diversity recruitment.\n      Recruitment will include, but not be limited to, establishing partnerships with\n      community-based organizations and other stakeholders to provide diverse candidate\n      pipelines and opportunities.\n          a. The recruiters will serve as a centralized resource to all City departments. They\n              will support enhanced diversity recruitment and will work with City departments\n              to develop recruitment activities and ensure recruitment and outreach efforts are\n              coordinated and effective at reaching a diverse pool of candidates.\n          b. This should occur as quickly as possible, and will be included in the FY 19-20\n              budget.\n\n   2. Training: DHR will significantly expand its harassment prevention, implicit bias, and\n      cross cultural communications trainings to a much broader segment of City employees.\n          a. All hiring managers and supervisors must take DHR’s online implicit bias\n             training, beginning January 1, 2019, and biannually thereafter.\n          b. All hiring managers, supervisors, and other employees who participate on hiring\n             panels must take a new “Fairness In Hiring” online training, beginning January 1,\n             2019, and annually thereafter.\n          c. All City employees must take Harassment Prevention Training, beginning January\n             1, 2019, and biannually thereafter.\n\f\nO F F I C E O F T H E M AY O R                                                       L O N D O N N. B R E E D\n  S A N F R AN C I S C O                                                                     MAYOR\n\n\n\n        3. Reporting: All City departments will begin reporting discipline to DHR so that potential\n           problematic areas, divisions, or other trouble spots can be quickly identified and\n           addressed. This reporting also ensures greater transparency in employee discipline across\n           all City departments and enables better monitoring of employee discipline across all City\n           Departments.\n               a. DHR will establish a checklist and supplemental training on disciplinary\n                   principles for all departments to ensure greater consistency and fairness.\n               b. All departments will begin collecting certain employment-related data by January\n                   1, 2019. The data will be reported to DHR annually, with the first report by July\n                   1, 2019. The report will include information on discipline (including written\n                   warnings, suspensions, and terminations), as well as probationary releases and\n                   Performance Improvement Plans.\n                        i. DHR will use this reporting to identify potential problematic areas, and\n                            work with departments to correct problems.\n                        ii. Solutions that may be applied include:\n                                1. Cross-cultural communications training;\n                                2. Targeted supervisor coaching;\n                                3. Supplemental review of proposed discipline which was\n                                   administered to employees;\n                                4. Discipline of employees administering discipline if warranted; and\n                                5. Any additional training or other measures which may be required\n                                   to ensure fairness in the workplace.\n               c. DHR should take steps to develop an electronic personnel file and the system to\n                   support it, in order to ensure consistent and accurate data collection and reporting.\n\n        4. Communication: Ensuring communication and collaboration on issues of equity,\n           diversity, and inclusion in the workplace is essential to fostering trust and accountability.\n           DHR will work collaboratively to convene a group of stakeholders which represent City\n           departments, labor unions, and stakeholders to continue to discuss ways the City can\n           improve on diversity and equity in our workplace.\n\n    This Executive Directive will take effect immediately, and will remain in place until rescinded\n    by future written communication.\n\n\n\n\n    London N.
